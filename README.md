## Description ##
The FBLikeButton Plugin for WordPress allows you to configure and display the FaceBook Like Button before and/or after each post and/or page, and whether or not you want the button to appear on your homepage.

The FaceBook Like Button enables users to make connections to your pages and share content back to their friends on Facebook with one click. Since the content is hosted by Facebook, the button can display personalized content whether or not the user has logged into your site. For logged-in Facebook users, the button is personalized to highlight friends who have also liked the page.

## Frequently Asked Questions ##
1. Can I put the FB Like Button in pages?<br />Not yet, but there are plans for that in the next few versions.
2. Can I modify the look and feel of the FB Like Button?<br />Yes, we've added the following attributes to the iframe tag:<br /> id="fbLikeIframe" name="fbLikeIframe" class="fbLikeContainer"
3. Will there be more versions?<br />Yes, there are several other little items we want to fix, but I wanted to get a working version out the door ASAP.
4. Why can I see my changes on preview, but not on my web pages?<br />The preview does not automatically save your changes to the database. You'll still need to hit the 'Update Options' button to make your changes permanent.
